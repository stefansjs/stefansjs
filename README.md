## Stefan Sullivan

I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience. This is my github where I mostly contribute to side projects, and occasional bug fixes to open source projects.

Some of the projects I'm most proud of are
  - [Flatbuffers IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/stefansjs/flatbuffers-intellij-plugin) is a plugin to perform syntax highlighting of the flatbuffers schema format for IntelliJ IDEs, like PyCharm, CLion, AppCode, etc.
  - [Filament Dehydrator](https://github.com/stefansjs/FilamentDehydrator) is a microcontroller project in micropython for creating a little heater for 3D printing plastic
  - [CDPlot](https://github.com/stefansjs/cdplot) is a python package for configuration-driven plotting of csv data. Write configs instead of code for plots.

These projects give a bit of a sense for what my code looks like. I try to stay organized, and I try to make sure I have a releasable version of software as much as possible.
